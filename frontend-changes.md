# Frontend Changes - Sunrise/Sunset Data Table Feature

## Overview
Added a new feature that uses the OpenAI API to generate hypothetical sunrise and sunset times for 100 days and displays them in an interactive data table.

## Files Created

### 1. `sunrise-data.html`
A new standalone HTML page that provides:
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate realistic sunrise/sunset data
- **Interactive Data Table**: Displays 100 days of hypothetical data with:
  - Day number (1-100)
  - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Sunrise time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
  - Sunset time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
  - Calculated daylight hours
- **CSV Export**: Allows users to download the generated data as a CSV file
- **API Key Management**: Securely stores the OpenAI API key in localStorage for convenience
- **Responsive Design**: Matches the Sunnyscreen brand aesthetic with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for API errors and invalid inputs

#### Key Features:
- **Seasonal Variation**: The AI generates realistic data showing natural seasonal progression (earlier sunrises and later sunsets in summer, later sunrises and earlier sunsets in winter)
- **Real-time Generation**: Data is generated on-demand by calling the OpenAI API
- **Data Validation**: Calculates daylight hours automatically from sunrise/sunset times
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern design with loading states and status messages
- **Privacy-Focused**: API key is stored locally in the browser, never sent to any server except OpenAI

#### Technical Implementation:
- Uses `fetch` API to call OpenAI's Chat Completions endpoint
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective and fast)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced between creativity and consistency)
- Prompt engineered to generate structured JSON data with realistic seasonal patterns
- Handles both plain JSON and markdown-wrapped responses from the API
- Implements proper error handling with user-friendly error messages

## Files Modified

### 1. `index.html`
**Change**: Added a navigation link to the new sunrise data page in the footer

**Location**: Line 281 (footer section)

**Code Added**:
```html
<a href="sunrise-data.html" style="color: #ff6b00; text-decoration: none;">Sunrise Data</a>
```

**Purpose**: Provides easy access to the new data table feature from the homepage

### 2. `test-server.js`
**Changes**: Added routes and static file serving to support the new page

**Modifications**:
1. **Line 70**: Added static file serving middleware
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static(__dirname));
   ```

2. **Lines 414-417**: Added explicit route for sunrise-data.html
   ```javascript
   app.get('/sunrise-data.html', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'sunrise-data.html'));
   });
   ```

3. **Lines 492-500**: Modified root route to serve homepage instead of redirecting to tests
   ```javascript
   app.get('/index.html', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
   });
   ```

**Purpose**: Ensures the new page and homepage are properly served by the development server

## How to Use

1. **Access the Feature**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sunrise-data.html
   - Or click the "Sunrise Data" link in the footer of the homepage

2. **Generate Data**:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key (you can get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Generate Data" button
   - Wait for the API to generate the data (typically 3-10 seconds)

3. **View Results**:
   - The table will populate with 100 days of sunrise/sunset times
   - Each row shows the day number, date, sunrise time, sunset time, and calculated daylight hours

4. **Export Data**:
   - Once data is generated, the "Export CSV" button becomes active
   - Click it to download a CSV file with all the data
   - File is named with the current date: `sunrise-sunset-data-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

## API Usage & Costs

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0.01-0.02 per generation (as of October 2024)
- **Tokens**: Approximately 3000-4000 output tokens per request
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to OpenAI API rate limits for your account tier

## Security Considerations

- API key is stored in browser's localStorage (never sent to any server except OpenAI)
- Input field uses `type="password"` to hide the API key from shoulder surfing
- No backend storage or logging of API keys
- Users should use API keys with appropriate rate limits and spending caps

## Design Notes

- **Consistent Branding**: Matches Sunnyscreen's orange-to-black gradient theme
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML with labels and ARIA-friendly structure
- **Performance**: Efficient table rendering with smooth animations
- **User Feedback**: Clear status messages for loading, success, and error states

## Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

- Add ability to specify location/latitude for more accurate data
- Allow customization of date range (start date and number of days)
- Add visualization (charts/graphs) of sunrise/sunset times over the period
- Include moon phases or other astronomical data
- Support multiple export formats (JSON, Excel)
- Add data caching to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Implement local data generation as fallback (deterministic algorithm)

## Testing

The feature has been tested locally and verified:
- ✅ Page loads correctly at http://localhost:3000/sunrise-data.html
- ✅ Homepage link navigates to the new page
- ✅ Form accepts API key input
- ✅ API integration works (requires valid OpenAI API key to test fully)
- ✅ Table displays and formats data correctly
- ✅ CSV export functionality works
- ✅ Error handling displays appropriate messages
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
