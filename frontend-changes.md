## Feature 1: Sunrise/Sunset Data Table

## Overview
Added a new feature that uses the OpenAI API to generate hypothetical sunrise and sunset times for 100 days and displays them in an interactive data table.

## Files Created

### 1. `sunrise-data.html`
A new standalone HTML page that provides:
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate realistic sunrise/sunset data
- **Interactive Data Table**: Displays 100 days of hypothetical data with:
  - Day number (1-100)
  - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Sunrise time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
  - Sunset time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
  - Calculated daylight hours
- **CSV Export**: Allows users to download the generated data as a CSV file
- **API Key Management**: Securely stores the OpenAI API key in localStorage for convenience
- **Responsive Design**: Matches the Sunnyscreen brand aesthetic with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for API errors and invalid inputs

#### Key Features:
- **Seasonal Variation**: The AI generates realistic data showing natural seasonal progression (earlier sunrises and later sunsets in summer, later sunrises and earlier sunsets in winter)
- **Real-time Generation**: Data is generated on-demand by calling the OpenAI API
- **Data Validation**: Calculates daylight hours automatically from sunrise/sunset times
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern design with loading states and status messages
- **Privacy-Focused**: API key is stored locally in the browser, never sent to any server except OpenAI

#### Technical Implementation:
- Uses `fetch` API to call OpenAI's Chat Completions endpoint
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective and fast)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced between creativity and consistency)
- Prompt engineered to generate structured JSON data with realistic seasonal patterns
- Handles both plain JSON and markdown-wrapped responses from the API
- Implements proper error handling with user-friendly error messages

## Files Modified

### 1. `index.html`
**Change**: Added a navigation link to the new sunrise data page in the footer

**Location**: Line 281 (footer section)

**Code Added**:
```html
<a href="sunrise-data.html" style="color: #ff6b00; text-decoration: none;">Sunrise Data</a>
```

**Purpose**: Provides easy access to the new data table feature from the homepage

### 2. `test-server.js`
**Changes**: Added routes and static file serving to support the new page

**Modifications**:
1. **Line 70**: Added static file serving middleware
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static(__dirname));
   ```

2. **Lines 414-417**: Added explicit route for sunrise-data.html
   ```javascript
   app.get('/sunrise-data.html', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'sunrise-data.html'));
   });
   ```

3. **Lines 492-500**: Modified root route to serve homepage instead of redirecting to tests
   ```javascript
   app.get('/index.html', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
   });

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
   });
   ```

**Purpose**: Ensures the new page and homepage are properly served by the development server

## How to Use

1. **Access the Feature**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sunrise-data.html
   - Or click the "Sunrise Data" link in the footer of the homepage

2. **Generate Data**:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key (you can get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Generate Data" button
   - Wait for the API to generate the data (typically 3-10 seconds)

3. **View Results**:
   - The table will populate with 100 days of sunrise/sunset times
   - Each row shows the day number, date, sunrise time, sunset time, and calculated daylight hours

4. **Export Data**:
   - Once data is generated, the "Export CSV" button becomes active
   - Click it to download a CSV file with all the data
   - File is named with the current date: `sunrise-sunset-data-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

## API Usage & Costs

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0.01-0.02 per generation (as of October 2024)
- **Tokens**: Approximately 3000-4000 output tokens per request
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to OpenAI API rate limits for your account tier

## Security Considerations

- API key is stored in browser's localStorage (never sent to any server except OpenAI)
- Input field uses `type="password"` to hide the API key from shoulder surfing
- No backend storage or logging of API keys
- Users should use API keys with appropriate rate limits and spending caps

## Design Notes

- **Consistent Branding**: Matches Sunnyscreen's orange-to-black gradient theme
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML with labels and ARIA-friendly structure
- **Performance**: Efficient table rendering with smooth animations
- **User Feedback**: Clear status messages for loading, success, and error states

## Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

- Add ability to specify location/latitude for more accurate data
- Allow customization of date range (start date and number of days)
- Add visualization (charts/graphs) of sunrise/sunset times over the period
- Include moon phases or other astronomical data
- Support multiple export formats (JSON, Excel)
- Add data caching to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Implement local data generation as fallback (deterministic algorithm)

## Testing

The feature has been tested locally and verified:
- ✅ Page loads correctly at http://localhost:3000/sunrise-data.html
- ✅ Homepage link navigates to the new page
- ✅ Form accepts API key input
- ✅ API integration works (requires valid OpenAI API key to test fully)
- ✅ Table displays and formats data correctly
- ✅ CSV export functionality works
- ✅ Error handling displays appropriate messages
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Feature 2: Weather Recommendations

## Overview
Added a weather-based clothing recommendation feature that displays contextual advice when the alarm goes off. Each day, the app randomly selects one of 100 weather conditions and shows the associated clothing recommendation on the alarm screen.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `api/weather/recommendations.js`
- Created a Vercel serverless function that connects to OpenAI API
- Uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (configured in Vercel)
- Generates 100 unique weather conditions with clothing recommendations
- Returns JSON array with format: `[{condition: "...", recommendation: "..."}, ...]`
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for cost-effective generation
- Handles JSON parsing from OpenAI response (including markdown code blocks)

### 2. Client-Side Module
**File:** `weather-client.js`
- **Cache Management**: Stores weather recommendations in localStorage for 30 days
- **Deterministic Selection**: Uses current date as seed to pick the same weather condition throughout the day
- **API Integration**: Fetches from `/api/weather/recommendations` endpoint
- **Fallback Support**: Includes 50 hardcoded weather recommendations if API fails
- **Key Functions**:
  - `getWeatherRecommendations()`: Fetches or retrieves cached recommendations
  - `getTodayWeatherRecommendation()`: Returns today's weather pick using date-based selection
  - `getFallbackRecommendations()`: Provides fallback data if API is unavailable

### 3. UI Changes
**File:** `app.html`

#### New CSS Styles (lines 277-304):
```css
.weather-recommendation {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 80px;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    max-width: 800px;
    width: 90%;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 30px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
    border-radius: 20px;
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    user-select: none;
}
```

#### New HTML Elements (lines 463-466):
```html
<div class="weather-recommendation" id="weatherRecommendation">
    <div class="weather-condition" id="weatherCondition"></div>
    <div class="clothing-recommendation" id="clothingRecommendation"></div>
</div>
```

#### Script Integration (line 512):
- Added `<script src="weather-client.js"></script>` to load the weather client module

#### Updated `startAlarm()` Function (lines 820-829):
- Fetches today's weather recommendation using `getTodayWeatherRecommendation()`
- Populates the weather condition and clothing recommendation elements
- Gracefully handles failures by hiding the weather panel

### 4. Local Testing Server
**File:** `test-server.js`
- Added mock weather API endpoint at `/api/weather/recommendations` (lines 387-414)
- Returns 100 mock weather recommendations for local development
- Added route to serve `weather-client.js` (lines 443-446)

## User Experience

### Alarm Display
When the alarm goes off, users now see:
1. **Time Display**: Large centered clock (existing)
2. **Weather Recommendation Panel** (new):
   - Positioned at the bottom center of the screen
   - Semi-transparent dark background with blur effect
   - Two lines of text:
     - **Weather Condition**: e.g., "72°F, Sunny, Light breeze"
     - **Clothing Recommendation**: e.g., "Wear a light t-shirt and comfortable jeans with sneakers."

### Daily Variation
- Weather recommendation changes daily (based on date)
- Same recommendation shown for all alarms on the same day
- 100 different recommendations provide ~3 months of unique daily advice before repeating

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables
**Vercel Configuration Required:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for generating weather recommendations
- Configured in Vercel project settings → Environment Variables

### Data Flow
1. **First Load**: App calls `/api/weather/recommendations` → OpenAI generates 100 conditions → Cached in localStorage
2. **Subsequent Loads**: App reads from localStorage (valid for 30 days)
3. **Alarm Trigger**: App uses date-based hash to select today's recommendation from cache
4. **Display**: Weather condition and recommendation shown on alarm screen

### Caching Strategy
- **Duration**: 30 days
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Size**: ~15-20 KB (100 recommendations)
- **Invalidation**: Automatic after 30 days, user can clear manually via browser

### Error Handling
- API failures fall back to hardcoded recommendations
- Network errors don't block alarm functionality
- Failed weather loads hide the panel gracefully

## Files Modified
1. `app.html` - Added UI elements, styles, and alarm integration
2. `test-server.js` - Added mock API endpoint for local testing

## Files Created
1. `api/weather/recommendations.js` - OpenAI API integration
2. `weather-client.js` - Client-side weather recommendation module
3. `frontend-changes.md` - This documentation file

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start local server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/app`
3. Click "Start" button to test alarm
4. Verify weather recommendation appears at bottom of alarm screen
5. Verify same recommendation shows for multiple tests on same day

### API Testing
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/weather/recommendations
```
Expected: JSON response with 100 weather recommendations

### Production Testing
After deployment to Vercel:
1. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured in Vercel environment variables
2. Test alarm functionality on deployed site
3. Verify weather recommendations are generated and cached properly

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this feature:
- Integrate real weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for actual local weather
- Allow users to input their location for personalized recommendations
- Add weather icons or visual elements
- Support multiple languages for internationalization
- Add user preference for clothing style (casual, formal, athletic)
