# Frontend Changes

## Animated Background Sunrise-to-Sunset Loop

### Overview
Implemented a 30-second looping CSS animation on the home page (index.html) that creates a continuous sunrise-to-sunset-to-sunrise cycle.

### Changes Made

#### File: `index.html`

**Modified `.hero` section (lines 22-32)**
- Removed static background gradient
- Added `animation: sunriseCycle 30s ease-in-out infinite;` to enable the background animation loop

**Added `@keyframes sunriseCycle` animation (lines 34-63)**
- 0% (0s): Night - Deep dark blues (#000428 to #004e92)
- 16.67% (5s): Pre-dawn - Dark blue to purple (#1a1a3e to #4a0e4e)
- 33.33% (10s): Sunrise - Purple to orange to yellow (#ff6b6b to #ffeb3b)
- 50% (15s): Full day - Bright blue sky (#00c6ff to #87ceeb)
- 66.67% (20s): Sunset - Yellow to orange to red (#ff6b00 to #c41e3a)
- 83.33% (25s): Dusk - Red to purple to dark blue (#4a0e4e to #1a1a3e)
- 100% (30s): Night - Returns to deep dark blues (completes loop)

**Enhanced `.hero::before` pseudo-element (lines 65-75)**
- Added `animation: sunGlow 30s ease-in-out infinite;` to animate the sun glow effect

**Added `@keyframes sunGlow` animation (lines 77-97)**
- 0%, 16.67%, 83.33%, 100%: Night/Dusk - No sun glow (opacity: 0)
- 33.33%: Sunrise - Orange glow at bottom (50% opacity)
- 50%: Day - Bright yellow glow at top (40% opacity)
- 66.67%: Sunset - Red-orange glow at bottom (50% opacity)

### Technical Details

**Animation Properties:**
- Duration: 30 seconds per complete cycle
- Timing function: `ease-in-out` for smooth transitions
- Iteration: `infinite` for continuous looping
- No animation delays or pauses

**Color Transitions:**
The animation uses CSS `linear-gradient` backgrounds that transition through six distinct phases:
1. Night (deep blues)
2. Pre-dawn (blue-purple)
3. Sunrise (orange-yellow)
4. Day (bright blue)
5. Sunset (yellow-red)
6. Dusk (purple-blue)

**Sun Glow Effect:**
A synchronized radial gradient overlay that:
- Appears and disappears based on time of day
- Moves from bottom (sunrise/sunset) to top (midday)
- Changes color to match the sky phase
- Uses opacity transitions for smooth fading

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers that support CSS animations
- Graceful degradation: If animations aren't supported, displays first keyframe (night sky)
- No JavaScript required - pure CSS implementation

### Performance
- Uses CSS animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Minimal performance impact
- No JavaScript timers or intervals
- Optimized for mobile devices

### Testing
Tested locally at http://localhost:3000/
- Animation loops seamlessly
- Smooth color transitions between phases
- Sun glow effect syncs correctly with background
- No visual glitches or stuttering
